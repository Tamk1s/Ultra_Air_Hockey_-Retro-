# Ultra_Air_Hockey_-Retro-
Retro ports of Ultra Air Hockey, EagleSoft Ltd's original air hockey video game,
to various retro video game consoles as homebrew!

Currently porting the game to the Sega Genesis/Sega CD using Stef's SGDK
(Sega Genesis Development Kit, https://github.com/Stephane-D/sgdk)

For compiling the game's assets, run .bat files near the .res files, and use the tools provided under
"Readme (For Devs).7z" file. For everything else, just use SGDK with your favorite C compiler
(Code::Blocks IDE highly recommended!)

At time of this writing, game dev is not complete, and the repo is being used to simply hold
a backup of development for source control purposes
